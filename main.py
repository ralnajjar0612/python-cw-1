# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
_num1 = 4
_num2 = 4
print (4+4)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print (4/4)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 2
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 3
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = 2*3
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print (f"The result is {area}.")

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.

width = 3
var2= 15
print (f"If the length of a rectangle is {var1}, and width is {width} then the area is {var2}.")
